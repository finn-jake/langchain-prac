Agents in Langchain are designed to perform specific tasks or processes, such as uploading files, analyzing dataframes, and keeping chat history for follow-up questions. They are essentially custom-built applications that can interact with users and perform various actions based on predefined rules or algorithms.\n\nLangchain provides a platform or library that allows users to build and manage these agents. The agents created using Langchain can leverage the capabilities of AI large language models (LLMs) through the integration of the Semantic Kernel (SK) lightweight SDK. The SK extensible programming model combines natural language semantic functions, traditional code native functions, and embeddings-based memory, unlocking new potential and adding value to applications with AI.\n\nOverall, agents in Langchain are programmable entities that can automate tasks, analyze data, and interact with users. They are built and managed using the Langchain platform or library, which incorporates cutting-edge design patterns from the latest in AI research."}]
